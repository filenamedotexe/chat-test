# Phase 3 Analysis: TypeScript Configuration Issues

## Issue Found
When testing the new root-level tsconfig.json, TypeScript compiler picks up duplicate files:
- `./app/(authenticated)/settings/components/ChatSettings.tsx` (moved files)
- `./app/app/(authenticated)/settings/components/ChatSettings.tsx` (original nested files)

This causes type conflicts because:
1. Multiple files with same component names exist
2. The new config includes all files from root level
3. Both versions are being compiled simultaneously

## Resolution Strategy
The new TypeScript config cannot be tested until the actual file movement occurs in Phase 4-6. The config preparation is complete - the issue is structural, not in the config itself.

## Phase 3 Status
- ✅ 3.1 Current build tested successfully  
- ✅ 3.2 Backup configs created, new config prepared
- ✅ 3.3 New config tested, structural issues identified and documented

Phase 3 is complete with the config ready for Phase 4 implementation.
