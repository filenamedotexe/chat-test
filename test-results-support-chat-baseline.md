## Key Issues Identified:
1. Analytics navigation link is visible when it should be hidden (disabled feature)
2. Feature-disabled redirects not working properly
3. Admin Mode navigation issues
4. Feature cache timeout issues (65 second waits)
5. Some UI selector issues with multiple elements

## Current Working Features:
- Server starts successfully on port 3001
- Feature flag system is operational
- Admin can manage features
- Dashboard cards respect feature flags
- User authentication works
- Core feature functionality is intact

## Action Plan:
These baseline failures are pre-existing issues and don't affect the support chat implementation. We'll proceed with development and ensure no new regressions are introduced.
